# Lessons 13 - Drills and Tips - Part 2

## Fizz Buzz
Write a piece of code that prints numbers 1 to 100, with the following conditions: 

- If the number is divisible by 3 then print `FIZZ` instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by 5 then print `BUZZ` instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by 5 and 3 then print `FIZZBUZZ` instead of the number.

Build the solution above using only the techniques we learned so far. For instance, refrain from using `if` or `case` statements, which we will cover later.
