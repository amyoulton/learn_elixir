# StarWars API Integration Project

We will integrate with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) to learn how to build out Elixir projects. This is my own version of building out the project. The original project tutorial can be found in the [Intro to Elixir](https://www.codecast.io/series/58-intro-to-elixir) course by [Tammam Kbeili](https://www.codecast.io/users/tam)
